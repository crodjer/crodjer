### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am Rohan.

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Atlassian.

Personally, I am trying to improve my Rust skills. I built [sysit](https://github.com/crodjer/sysit),
a light weight tool to monitor system resources. Primarily, for my
Raspberry Pis.
Lately, I have been also contributing to
[helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pulls?q=author%3Acrodjer+)
editor. It looks promising to me. Although, Neovim's still my go-to.
Hopefully, I'd get to write Rust professionally.

Python and Haskell are the languages I think code in. Professionally,
I have worked with Python, Ruby, Clojure and Java.
